EMERGENCY FIX - DATABASE_METHODS Not Loading
================================================================================

PROBLEM CONFIRMED:
------------------
✅ Schema updated correctly
✅ save_content.php works correctly
❌ DATABASE_METHODS script not loading in browser
❌ Admin form falls back to localStorage

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Production server has OLD version of admin/index.html
The updated version with DATABASE_METHODS (line 1729-1863) is not uploaded

IMMEDIATE FIX (2 Options):
==========================

OPTION 1: Upload Updated admin/index.html (RECOMMENDED)
---------------------------------------------------------
The admin/index.html in your local folder HAS the DATABASE_METHODS script.
Production server DOES NOT have it.

Steps:
1. Upload the LOCAL file to production:
   From: /home/andrew/Documents/Untitled Folder/alice/themes.webdevia.com/petroleum-gas/admin/index.html
   To: testing.catehotel.co.tz/admin/index.html

2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

3. Reload admin page

4. Check console - should see:
   "Database methods loaded and ready for injection"

5. Try saving - should see:
   "Content saved successfully to database!"


OPTION 2: Use Emergency Injection Script (QUICK WORKAROUND)
------------------------------------------------------------
If you can't upload admin/index.html yet, use this workaround:

Steps:
1. Upload inject_database_methods.js to production

2. Edit production's admin/index.html via cPanel File Manager or FTP

3. Find this line (near the end, before </body>):
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@3/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script>

4. Add AFTER it:
   <script src="/inject_database_methods.js"></script>

5. Save file

6. Reload admin page in browser

7. Should now work!


VERIFICATION:
=============

After either fix, test in browser console:

1. Open: http://testing.catehotel.co.tz/admin/
2. Press F12 (open console)
3. Type: window.DATABASE_METHODS
4. Press Enter

Should show:
{
  deepMerge: function,
  isObject: function,
  saveContent: function,
  loadContent: function
}

If it shows "undefined" - fix didn't work yet.


FULL TEST:
==========

1. Go to admin → Navbar Settings
2. Enter logo URL: /uploads/LG24_-_Group_1759092498.jpg
3. Click "Save Navbar Settings"
4. Console should show:
   ✅ "Using database integration for save"
   ✅ "Saving content to database..."
   ✅ "Content saved successfully to database!"

5. NOT this (bad):
   ❌ "Database integration not available"
   ❌ "Content saved to local storage (fallback mode)"

6. Reload page - logo URL should still be there
7. Check database:
   SELECT logo_main FROM site_settings WHERE id=1;
   Should show: /uploads/LG24_-_Group_1759092498.jpg


WHY THIS HAPPENED:
==================

The local admin/index.html was updated with DATABASE_METHODS script.
But production server still has the old version without it.

Solution: Upload the updated admin/index.html to production.


FILES TO UPLOAD:
================

Priority 1 (Required):
  ✓ admin/index.html (MAIN FIX - has DATABASE_METHODS built-in)

Priority 2 (If can't upload index.html):
  ✓ inject_database_methods.js (Emergency workaround)
  ✓ Then add <script> tag to existing index.html on server

Priority 3 (Already done):
  ✓ admin/save_content.php (already updated)
  ✓ auto_update_schema.php (already ran)


FASTEST FIX:
============

Just upload admin/index.html from local to production!

That file already has:
✅ DATABASE_METHODS script (lines 1729-1863)
✅ Updated saveContent method (lines 2599-2613)
✅ Updated loadContent method (lines 2615-2633)
✅ All form fields properly connected

It's complete and ready to use!


NEXT STEPS AFTER FIX:
=====================

Once DATABASE_METHODS loads:

1. ✅ All admin forms will save to database
2. ✅ Changes will persist after reload
3. ✅ Logo URLs will save correctly
4. ✅ Website will auto-regenerate
5. ✅ No more localStorage fallback

Then you can:
- Import media files (import_existing_media.php)
- Fix navbar styling (fix_navbar_dropdown.css)
- Test all admin sections
- Configure dropdown menus
- Everything will work!


CONTACT:
========

After uploading admin/index.html:
- Run check_save_flow.html again
- Test 1 should now show: ✅ DATABASE_METHODS exists
- Share results if still issues
